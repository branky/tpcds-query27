We are trying to re-create the behaviour of Query27 from TPC-DS benchmark 

select
  i_item_id,
  s_state,
  avg(ss_quantity) agg1,
  avg(ss_list_price) agg2,
  avg(ss_coupon_amt) agg3,
  avg(ss_sales_price) agg4
from store_sales
join date_dim on (store_sales.ss_sold_date_sk = date_dim.d_date_sk)
join item on (store_sales.ss_item_sk = item.i_item_sk)
join customer_demographics on (store_sales.ss_c_demo_sk = customer_demographics.cd_demo_sk)
join store on (store_sales.ss_store_sk = store.s_store_sk)
where
  cd_gender = 'M' and
  cd_martial_status = 'S' and
  cd_education_status = 'College' and
  d_year = 2002 and
  s_state in ('TN','SD')
group by
  i_item_id,
  s_state
order by
  i_item_id,
  s_state
limit 100;


With store_sales being the big table and the rest of the tables being reduced to map-join hashes.

We end up with 4 table schemas
